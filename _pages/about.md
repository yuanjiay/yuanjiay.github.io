I am an ex-software development engineer at Amazon AGI, focusing on developing data preparation infrastructure used for large language model training. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a B.S. in Neuroscience and Computer Science and currently a part-time master student in Computational Linguistics at University of Washington Seattle. I am passionate about the interdisciplinary potential between robotics and language, especially how to leverage foundational models, such as vision-langauge-model (VLM), vision-language-action model (VLA) to improve the generalization and robustiness of robot policies.

During the spare time, I enjoy running, reading, and hanging out with my [cat](https://yuanjiayiy.github.io/chunky/).
