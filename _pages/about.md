I am an ex-software development engineer working at Amazon AGI, focusing on developing data preparation infrastructure used for large language model training. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a B.S. in Neuroscience and Computer Science (Go Tartan!) and currently a part-time master student in Computational Linguistics at University of Washington Seattle (Go Huskie!). She is passionate about the interdisciplinary potential between robotics and artificial intelligence, especially how to leverage foundational models, such as vision-langauge-model (VLM), vision-language-action model (VLA) to improve the generalization and robustiness of robot policies. 

During the spare time, I enjoy running, reading, and hanging out with her cat. She is currently building a robot cat companion for her cat, which kinda freaks her cat out.
